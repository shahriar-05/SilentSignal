SilentSignals
Making silent emotional distress visible

Overview
SilentSignals is an assistive emotional monitoring system designed to support patients experiencing depression or recovering after suicide attempts. It helps doctors gain early awareness of emotional distress that often goes unspoken.

Instead of displaying raw video or medical labels, the system converts emotional signals into abstract visual patterns. This approach preserves privacy while enabling intuitive understanding.

SilentSignals does not diagnose or predict. It supports human decision-making.

Theme Alignment (Theme-w5)
“Could a feeling hide inside a visual pattern, waiting for someone to understand it?”

SilentSignals answers this by embedding emotional states within abstract visuals that doctors interpret without explicit labels or scores.
